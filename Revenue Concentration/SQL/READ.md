# SQL Project – Revenue Concentration & Pareto Analysis

This project demonstrates the use of SQL to analyze revenue concentration across brands and products to evaluate whether the business follows the Pareto (80/20) principle or exhibits a diversified revenue distribution.

---

## Objective

To assess how revenue is distributed across brands and products by calculating contribution percentages, cumulative revenue, and ranking metrics using SQL.

---

## Key Analysis Performed

- Calculated total business revenue, quantity sold, and profit using transactional sales data
- Ranked brands by revenue to identify top-performing contributors
- Computed brand-level revenue contribution percentages and cumulative revenue contribution
- Measured the combined contribution of the top 10 brands to validate adherence to the Pareto principle
- Performed product-level drill-down analysis within the highest revenue-generating brand (Hermanos)
- Ranked products and calculated cumulative contribution to evaluate concentration patterns within the selected brand
- Used aggregations, joins, Cross Joins, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and Window Functions for structured cumulative analysis

---

## Key Insights

- The top 10 brands contributed only 26.47% of total revenue, indicating weak adherence to the traditional 80/20 Pareto principle
- The highest revenue-generating brand (Hermanos) accounted for only ~3.2% of total revenue
- Revenue was broadly distributed across brands rather than concentrated among a few dominant contributors
- Product-level drill-down analysis within Hermanos also showed diversified contribution patterns
- The business demonstrates a long-tail revenue structure, reducing dependency risk on individual brands

---

## Tools Used

- SQL Joins
- Aggregations
- Cross Joins
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Window Functions (`RANK()`, `SUM() OVER()`, cumulative calculations)

## Project Outcome

This analysis demonstrated that Maven Market's revenue is widely distributed across brands and products rather than dominated by a small number of contributors. The findings challenge the traditional Pareto assumption and highlight the importance of validating business rules using actual data.
